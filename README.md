# React CRUD Simple App

Developed using the MERN Stack, this CRUD application is powered by ReactJS, React Router Dom, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM.

**To streamline the process, you can easily import the 'Cruds' JSON file into your MongoDB. Locate this file within the Server Folder for quick integration.**
